# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

Yet another [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) implementation of Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

Implementing this book tutorial was a very good way to learn a new language, Rust, so this is not the best code around.
